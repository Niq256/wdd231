            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Color:</strong> `#2C3E50` (Dark Blue/Charcoal) - Used for headings (h1, h2, h3), primary text, and navigation backgrounds. This color evokes a sense of stability, trustworthiness, and depth, aligning with the thoughtful nature of Christian content.</li>
                <li><strong>Accent Color:</strong> `#5C3B05` (Very dark brown) - This deep brown can instantly evoke a sense of tradition, heritage, and timelessness. For a Christian movie site, this can subtly communicate the enduring nature of faith, biblical stories, and historical narratives often found in such films.</li>
                <li><strong>Background Color:</strong> `#ECF0F1` (Light Gray) - Used for the main body background. This light, neutral color provides a clean and readable canvas for the content, ensuring good contrast with the text colors.</li>
